# Design-of-a-16-bit-Ripple-Carry-Adder
A Ripple Carry Adder (RCA) is the simplest form of a binary adder used to perform arithmetic addition of multi-bit binary numbers. It consists of a series of full adders connected in a chain, where the carry-out of each full adder is connected to the carry-in of the next.

Operation
Each full adder takes three inputs:

Two operand bits: 
𝐴
𝑖
A 
i
​
  and 
𝐵
𝑖
B 
i
​
 

Carry-in: 
𝐶
𝑖
C 
i
​
 

It produces two outputs:

Sum: 
𝑆
𝑖
=
𝐴
𝑖
⊕
𝐵
𝑖
⊕
𝐶
𝑖
S 
i
​
 =A 
i
​
 ⊕B 
i
​
 ⊕C 
i
​
 

Carry-out: 
𝐶
𝑖
+

=
(
𝐴
𝑖
⋅
𝐵
𝑖
)
+
(
𝐶
𝑖
⋅
(
𝐴
𝑖
⊕
𝐵

)
)
C 
i+1
​
 =(A 
i
​
 ⋅B 
i
​
 )+(C 
i
​
 ⋅(A 
i
​
 ⊕B 
i
​
 ))

This process is repeated from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB), with each stage relying on the carry output from the previous stage.

⏱ Disadvantages in Speed
The main limitation of the ripple carry adder is speed. Since each full adder must wait for the carry bit from the previous adder, the total delay is proportional to the number of bits. This means:

For an n-bit RCA, the worst-case delay occurs when the carry ripples through all n stages.

The delay increases linearly (O(n)) with the number of bits.

As a result, ripple carry adders are slower than more advanced adders like the Carry Lookahead Adder, especially in high-speed or large-bit-width applications such as modern processors.
